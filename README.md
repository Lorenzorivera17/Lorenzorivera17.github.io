I am a Computer engineering major at CSUF and I plan on becoming a disney imagineer one day.


Lab 1 part 1 
  This was one of my favorite labs because it was our introduction into the world of C++. It can with plenty of challenge as it was our first lab and our first introduction to a new coding language. Once we had figured it out it, it opened the world up to many different configurations. 

Lab 12 part 1 
  This was a good lab because it was the most challenging, it had put all our skills to us. It also came out with a cool outcome compared to the other labs we had done.  Overall, all the labs taught us many things, but this one allowed to put it all to us. 

Lab 8 
  Overall bought part of this lab was fun, due to the lesson shown to us by the professor on how to play blackjack. We put a lesson we learned in class and forged into our world of coding, and it made it stand out compared to the other labs. All labs had a lesson, but I found this one to be the best.
